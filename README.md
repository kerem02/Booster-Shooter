# Booster-Shooter

This is a 2D space shooter game consisting of 3 levels. The player controls a spaceship and fights against waves of enemies using standard shooting mechanics. A jet boost feature has been added, which can be activated by pressing the F key. When used, it triggers a visual effect, a sound, and a camera shake, along with a boost bar at the bottom of the screen that shows the remaining boost power.

There are also two power-ups available during gameplay: Multishot, which increases the number of bullets fired, and Shield, which temporarily protects the player from taking damage. At the end of the game, a boss fight provides an extra challenge. In addition to these features, the game includes small improvements such as updated UI elements, background music, and sound effects.
